# Python Module 01: CodeCultivation
**CodeCultivation: Object-Oriented Garden Systems** is a Python-based project designed to transition learners from basic procedural programming to advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) architectures. By building a digital garden ecosystem, students develop tools for community garden management, starting with simple program structures and progressing through complex data modelling. The curriculum emphasises practical skills such as **data encapsulation**, **inheritance**, and **system scalability**.

## Instructions

## Exercises
### Exercise 0: Planting Your First Seed
The focus here is on the mechanics of how Python code transitions from a text file to a running process.
- The Global Namespace: Understanding how variables are stored when not inside a function or class.
- The `__name__ Variable`: Theory behind Python's internal naming of modules and how it changes based on execution context.
- Standard Output (`STDOUT`): How the `print()` function interacts with the terminal.
- Scripting Fundamentals: The role of the "Shebang" line (`#!`) in Unix-like environments.
