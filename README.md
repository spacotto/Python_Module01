# Python Module 01: CodeCultivation, Object-Oriented Garden Systems
This module provides a structured pedagogical path that transitions students from basic Python execution to designing complex, scalable software architectures. By incrementally building a garden management system, it ensures that learners first master fundamental program structures (such as the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block) before introducing the more abstract concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** like **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism**. The project requires students to implement **data validation** and **secure interfaces** to **prevent system corruption**.

## Instructions

## Exercises
### Exercise 0: Planting Your First Seed
* **Script Execution (Shebang)**: Understanding how the computer locates the Python interpreter to run the file (often marked by `#!` at the very top of a script).
* **The Entry Point (`if __name__ == "__main__":`)**: This pattern ensures that code inside the block only runs when the script is executed directly, preventing accidental execution when the file is imported as a module.
* **Variables and Type Hinting**: Using `variable: type = value` (e.g., `age: int = 30`) provides explicit documentation for the data types, aiding in code clarity and error prevention.
* **Docstrings**: Multi-line strings used at the start of modules and functions to describe their purpose and behavior.
* **Standard Output**: Utilizing the `print()` function to present formatted data to the user.
