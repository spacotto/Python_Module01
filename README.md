# Python Module 01: CodeCultivation, Object-Oriented Garden Systems
This module provides a structured pedagogical path that transitions students from basic Python execution to designing complex, scalable software architectures. By incrementally building a garden management system, it ensures that learners first master fundamental program structures (such as the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block) before introducing the more abstract concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** like **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism**. The project requires students to implement **data validation** and **secure interfaces** to **prevent system corruption**.
