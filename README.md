# Python Module 01
**CodeCultivation, Object-Oriented Garden Systems:** learn **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** by becoming a digital gardener—because, apparently, the best way to understand classes is to grow virtual plants and realize you've been doing OOP all along! 🌱💻

## Instructions
Git clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/spacotto/Python_Module01.git
```
Each file includes a main. Thus, you can directly execute the files. For example:
```
python3 ex/ft_garden_intro.py
```

## Theoretical Concepts
The theoretical concepts covered in this module are documented in myseparate notes repository:
- [PYTHON 101 — PART VI: OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING (CHAPTERS 15–23)](https://github.com/spacotto/grimoire/blob/main/python/_index(python).md#part-vi-object-oriented-programming)
